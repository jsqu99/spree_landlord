---- missed test!  having a tenant name excplicity set in the dsl.  that should override the path entry
---- skipping the auto-detect of tenant name for dsls and requiring that you explicity set it
---- need a test for sources/template 
     




extensible way of modifying environment.rb's path...use Rails 'path'

get deface to use that mechanism..and in the landlord initializer modify that

different paths for each test...so no need to cleanup overrides



look at assets rakefile for magic for each rails env if i need it for override precompilation

https://github.com/railsdog/spree_landlord/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb#L3 vs. copying in Rakefile
move https://github.com/jsqu99/spree_landlord/blob/topic/deface/spec/spec_helper.rb#L65 to it's own file in support

have rake task invoke refactored code that lives in a class - https://github.com/spree/deface/pull/78

uncomment https://github.com/jsqu99/spree_landlord/blob/topic/deface/lib/spree/spree_landlord/tenant_helpers.rb#L21 then prepend!!!!
remove block at line #29

revisit using disabled

extend deface to support adding actions (:tenant_name)
